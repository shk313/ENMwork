# ENMwork
============

Overview
========

Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) are popular tools used to predict current and future distributions of species.
Predicting the distribution of vectors of infectious diseases is a particularly pressing concern for public health
globally as changes in climate, land-use and human populations are provoking these species to expand and intensify geographically.
Despite the system application of ENMs, when predictions are made rarely is the inherent assumption of niche conservatism tested.
As a result, predictions can be misleading. Assessing the transferability of ENMs for six important vector-borne diseases,
this study tests the assumption of niche conservatism.
